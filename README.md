# Web-Crawler-and-Scraper
This is the website crawler (and scraper) project.


This project I divided in two parts.

# 1 Web Crawler : 

In first part, I used Selenium web-based automation tool for collecting (web-craling) subsequent links from website url ( site-map if avialable on website ). And go in depth upto 5 level to collect the maximum links. Then save the final output in excel file using pandas.

# 2 Web Scraper :

In second part, I used BeautifulSoup Python library for scrap the relevent text from saved links in first part. Take each link and scraped the text that contains the  specific keywords. And save the output in excel file.

After that I add Context Keywords side to keyword columns which is present in text, write N/A if not available.

Conclusion : From this project we can collect the text from anywebsite which contain the specific keywords and also this program is flexible to used it for another purpose. And from this project I learned new tool Selenium and improved my Python concepts.
